#simple-signaling-server

This project aims to provide a very simple Nodejs server to ease the very first
signaling part of the WebRTC protocol. It is worth noting that none of the
STUN, ICE, TURN calls are done at the server side. Thus, the server is only
a bridge between two peers which are not connected through WebRTC.
